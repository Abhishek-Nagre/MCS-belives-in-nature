                        MCS Group’s Dualator series of products are a cost-effective solution for many groundwater systems. These gravity filters incorporate aeration, detention and filtration in a single structure, considerably decreasing the footprint of a plant. They also have the capability of meeting a large range of flow rates, from 80 gpm to 2 MGD in one process train. MCS Group will customize and provide the controls required for these applications, as well as any other control features required. Dualator systems are designed to meet USEPA, Ten States Standards, and Canadian requirements for iron, manganese, and arsenic removal applications.
                           <ul>
                               <li>The Dualator III can be used for iron, manganese, arsenic and radium removal. Rectangular with a multi-cell filter, a detention tank is also featured. This design is commonly used in applications where the effluent from the filter is collected in the underdrain and routed to a clearwell.</li>
                               <li>The Dualator VI has a taller profile, cylindrical filter and capability of treating iron, manganese, arsenic and radium. This design includes aeration, detention chamber and a four-cell filter, and can incorporate an air stripping element, which expands its applications.</li>
