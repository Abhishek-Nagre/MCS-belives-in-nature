                    A critical part of the treatment vessel refurbishment process is the replacement of internal distributors/collectors. Proper design of the internals and the internal support systems is vital to ensure the equipment will perform as designed, and media channeling will be avoided. We work closely with engineers, contractors and our customers to determine the operational requirements to integrate a custom internal design into any type of treatment vessel.                       </div>
