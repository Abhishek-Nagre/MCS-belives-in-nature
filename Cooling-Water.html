                MCS Group’s integrated cooling water solutions has extraordinary capabilities with respect to equipment systems, and software that complement the world-class chemistries to produce a fully integrated cooling offering. These include:
                    <ul>
                       <li>Chemical storage and injection systems, both standardized and highly customized</li>
                       <li>Solid chemical delivery systems</li>
                       <li>Highly advanced Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring and control platform</li>
                       <li>Cloud-based analytics, information management, and communications</li>
                       <li>Packaged Cooling Tower Blowdown Recovery (CTBR) systems</li>
                       <li>Innovative side stream filtration</li>
                   </ul>
                    Monitoring of key operational and chemical parameters with 24/365 internet accessibility, online availability of operator logs and service reports, alarming and notifications provide operating personnel with the information they need, when they need it, and in the form they want it. The ability to react quickly to developing conditions before they lead to impaired or interrupted operations is critical. Coupling MCS Group's boiler water treatment chemistries with its automation and control capabilities assures optimum performance, reliability, communication, and cost-effectiveness. These capabilities not only enhance this assurance, but also showcase documented improvements, return on investment, as well as additional program enhancement opportunities.
